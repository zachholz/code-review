# Code Review for Git/HTML/CSS 

### A Basic Portfolio Page using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap CSS

### By Zach Holz

## This page is the code review for the first section of the evening Intro to Programming class by Epicodus. It showcases work done with pairs over the course of the first four weeks of the program. 

## To setup: 
* Clone this repo to your heart's content
* Edit away. 

Currently, this project is hosted on a [Github page](http://zachholz.github.io/code-review).

## Known Bugs

The header has a bit of white space right below the mocassin colored border; it has something to do with the

    nav { float: left; }
    
rule, but I'm unsure how to fix it at the time.
